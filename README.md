# OpenCTF - component test framework

The OpenCTF component test framework helps to build automatic tests for all (visual and non-visual) VCL components in a Delphi application. It is based on the DUnit framework.

Compiled and tested with Delphi 2009.

Build scripts for documentation and distribution require additional tools (see readme.txt).
